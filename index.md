## What's up with _leMaik's Chunky_?

Originally created to add some 1.14 blocks, [my fork](https://github.com/leMaik/chunky) quickly blew up to fully support Minecraft 1.14 and 1.15 while also fixing long-standing bugs.  
Meanwhile, the fork was merged into [the original Chunky](http://chunky.llbit.se) and I continue development over there (via pull requests from the fork).

However, the latest launcher versions, information on Chunky development and everything else will continue to be published on _this_ site.
