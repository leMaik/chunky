Chunky is a Minecraft rendering tool that uses path tracing to create beautiful images of your buildings.

## Installation

Get the latest version of the Chunky launcher from [here](https://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/ChunkyLauncher.jar) and start it. Press _Check for update_ to get the latest version of Chunky.

If you want to get the latest snapshots, make sure to tick the _Download snapshots_ checkbox before checking for updates.

_More detailed instructions with screenshots are available [on this page]({{ absolute_url }}installation)._

- Supports Minecraft 1.13, 1.14, 1.15 and 1.16 (see [the list of supported blocks]({{ absolute_url }}supported-blocks))
- Improved Slime rendering
- Map for 1.14+ worlds

## Planned features

- Support new snapshots shortly after they are released (see [the list of supported blocks]({{ absolute_url }}supported-blocks))
- Support for custom block models from resource packs

## What's up with _leMaik's Chunky_?

Originally created to add some 1.14 blocks, [my fork](https://github.com/leMaik/chunky) quickly blew up to fully support Minecraft 1.14 and 1.15 while also fixing long-standing bugs.  
Meanwhile, the fork was merged into [the original Chunky](http://chunky.llbit.se) and I continue development over there (via pull requests from the fork).

However, the latest launcher versions, information on Chunky development and everything else will continue to be published on _this_ site.
