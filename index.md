# Chunky for Minecraft 1.14+

Chunky is a Minecraft mapping and rendering tool. leMaik's Chunky is a fork of Chunky that aims to add new features and fix old bugs. The main goal is to add support for new Minecraft versions.

## Why did you fork Chunky?

Originally created to add some 1.14 blocks, this fork quickly blew up to fully support Minecraft 1.14 and 1.15 while also fixing long-standing upstream bugs. If [upstream Chunky](http://chunky.llbit.se) development continues one day, this fork might be merged into it.

## Installation

You'll need Chunky Launcher v1.11 or later or the forked version, which you can get [here](http://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/ChunkyLauncher.jar).

To get the fork instead of upstream Chunky, make sure that the _Update Site_ is set to `http://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/`. Press _Check for update_ to get the latest version of Chunky.

If you want to get the latest snapshots, make sure to tick the _Download snapshots_ checkbox before checking for updates.

_More detailed instructions with screenshots are available [on this page]({{ absolute_url }}installation)._

## Features

- Supports all 1.14 blocks
- Supports all 1.15 honey-related blocks
- Supports all 1.16 blocks (as of 20w16a)
- Improved Slime rendering
- Improved stairs rendering
- Map for 1.14+ worlds

## Planned features

- Support 1.16 blocks shortly after 1.16 is released (see [the list of supported blocks]({{ absolute_url }}supported-blocks))
- Support for custom block models from resource packs
