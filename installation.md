# Installation

1. Open the Chunky launcher. If you don't have it yet, you can download the forked version [here](http://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/ChunkyLauncher.jar).

   If the launcher doesn't open, start it with `--launcher`, e.g. `java -jar path/to/ChunkyLauncher.jar --launcher`

   You can also use llbit's [original launcher](http://chunky.llbit.se/download.html) (v1.11 or later).

2. Set the _Update Site_ to `http://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/`.

   If something goes wrong while updating, make sure that you got the _Update site_ right. The `/` at the end is important!

5. After updating, click on _Launch Chunky_ to start Chunky. If there was no update available, just click on _Launch_ in the main window of the launcher.

6. This is the most important step. Enjoy using Chunky to render your 1.14 and 1.15 worlds!
