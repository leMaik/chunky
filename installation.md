# Installation

1. Download the latest Chunky Launcher from [here](https://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/ChunkyLauncher.jar) and start it.

   If the launcher doesn't open with a double click make sure you have Java 8 installed first [get it from here](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp). **Make sure that you use the 64-bit version of Java if you use a 64-bit operating system.**
   
   Otherwise start it from the console, e.g. `java -jar path/to/ChunkyLauncher.jar --launcher`

2. If you want to get the latest snapshot, check the _Download snapshots_ checkbox. Then press _Check for update_ to get the latest version of Chunky.

   If something goes wrong while updating, make sure that you are using the latest version of the launcher.

4. After updating, click on _Launch Chunky_ to start Chunky. If there was no update available, just click on _Launch_ in the main window of the launcher.

5. This is the most important step. Enjoy using Chunky to render your 1.14 and 1.15 worlds!
