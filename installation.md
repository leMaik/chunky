# Installation

1. Download the latest Chunky Launcher from [here](https://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/ChunkyLauncher.jar) and start it.

   If the launcher doesn't open with a double click make sure you have Java 8 installed first ([get it from here](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)). **Make sure that you use the 64-bit version of Java if you use a 64-bit operating system.**

   Otherwise start it from the console, e.g. `java -jar path/to/ChunkyLauncher.jar --launcher`

2. Make sure that the _Update Site_ is set to `https://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/`

3. If you want to get the latest snapshot, check the _Download snapshots_ checkbox. Snapshots are built every night from the [master branch](https://github.com/chunky-dev/chunky/commits/master).

   Then press _Check for update_ to get the latest version of Chunky.

4. If there is a new version, a new window will open. Click on _Update to new version_ to download the new version.

   If something goes wrong while updating, make sure that you are using the latest version of the launcher.

5. After updating, click on _Launch Chunky_ to start Chunky. If there was no update available, just click on _Launch_ in the main window of the launcher.

6. This is the most important step. Enjoy using Chunky to render your 1.14, 1.15 and 1.16 worlds!
