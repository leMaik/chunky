# Installation

1. Open **Chunky Launcher v1.11** or later. If you don't have it yet, you can download the forked version [here](https://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/ChunkyLauncher.jar).

   If the launcher doesn't open with a double click make sure you have Java 8 installed first ([get it from here](https://java.com/download/)).
   Otherwise start it with the following command `--launcher`, e.g. `java -jar path/to/ChunkyLauncher.jar --launcher`

   You can also use llbit's original launcher by selecting the Launcher Only download option [here](http://chunky.llbit.se/download.html) (v1.11 or later).

2. Set the _Update Site_ to `https://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/` (Should be set by default with forked launcher).

   If something goes wrong while updating, make sure that you got the _Update site_ right. The `/` at the end is important!

5. After updating, click on _Launch Chunky_ to start Chunky. If there was no update available, just click on _Launch_ in the main window of the launcher.

6. This is the most important step. Enjoy using Chunky to render your 1.14 and 1.15 worlds!
